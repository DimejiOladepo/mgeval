An Objective evaluation toolbox for symbolic domain music generation

## Introduction:

### Why?
Machine learning and neural networks have demonsrate great potential in music generation. However, vary goals and definition of creativity makes evaluation toward generative music challenging. In recent research, subjective evaluations seem to the only viable way to do this.

The goal of this toolbox is to provide an objective evaluation system to have a better reliability, validity, and replicability in the music generation.

### How?

The toolbox propose a set of musically informed objective measures to obtain analyses that further driven series of evaluation strategy that involves:

1. Absolute metrics that can provide insights into properties of generated or collected set of data
 
2. Relative metrics in order to compare two sets of data, e.g., training and generated.
